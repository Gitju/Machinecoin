Description: peer-to-peer network based digital currency - daemon
 Machinecoin is an experimental new digital currency that enables instant
 payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Machinecoin uses peer-to-peer
 technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions
 and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. Machinecoin Core
 is the name of the open source software which enables the use of this currency.
 .
 This package provides the daemon, machinecoind, and the CLI tool
 machinecoin-cli to interact with the daemon.

Description: peer-to-peer digital currency - standalone transaction tool
 Machinecoin is an experimental new digital currency that enables instant
 payments to anyone, anywhere in the world. Machinecoin uses peer-to-peer
 technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions
 and issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. Machinecoin Core
 is the name of the open source software which enables the use of this currency.
 .
 This package provides machinecoin-tx, a command-line transaction creation
 tool which can be used without a machinecoin daemon.  Some means of
 exchanging minimal transaction data with peers is still required.
